## Adding to this List

1. Go to the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ai2sCp3HpDyGdDRVZWJmaGItaU5BY0NDWEFfY3cyU1E&usp=sharing)
2. Add your link(s)
  * Each link should include a title, url, and description
  * In your description, rank the link on difficulty, from a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 is "What is JavaScript?" and 5 is "Go forth, young padawon, rely on your training and you will succeed!")
